###### instruction for executing project
there are a few thing has to be done constantly, for example Excuting sts, refreshing MySQL droping the Account and Customer Tabel constanting before Executing of runing STS also never repeatativtly runing spring boot application as it will use the same port and casue a error. also make sure port 8080 is always available.  
### code for add in Postman
{
    "accountBalance": 450,
    "accountName": "jason account",
    "numAccount": 2
}

### request for deleting account
localhost:8080/deleteAccount/1
### update Account 
localhost:8080/updateAccount/2
{
    "accountBalance": 450,
    "accountName": "jason account",
    "numAccount": 2
}
### read all account 
localhost:8080/allAccount
###### 
in future i would like to find out the reason why the image is not uploading it the README file and make sure that i fix the issue with the Junit CRUD test, also consider linking account balance to a third table so it would contain with draw and depositing money, i would also consider making add more example code to the read me file so it can demenstrate other freaure of this project
